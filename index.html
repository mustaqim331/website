        Hi, you must be wondering what this is all about, right? Remember when I asked you about roses during one of our outings a few days back? You probably don’t, but it’s okay because it wasn’t something we discussed a lot. However, you did say that you love flowers and once had a rose when you were a kid. You said that you placed it outside your house one time and most of the kids touched it, and it died. I don’t know why, but I find it sad that your flower had to die like that :( ... Wait!!! Maybe it was sunflowers, I can't quite remember haha, welp... Anyway, the story inspired me to make you a flower that will never die, and it will be here for the rest of your life. <br><br>

        I also made this because I wanted to show you how much I appreciate you being here. Meeting you this year was the best thing that has ever happened to me in a long time. You are so effortlessly pretty every time I see you, you don't have to be insecure about anything because to me you are "perfect". You are the most hardworking person I have ever met, and what you have achieved just shows how smart and amazing of a person you are (and you had the audacity to doubt yourself... smh). You are so full of passion in helping others including me and I loveeeeeee you for that. The list would be too long if I mentioned all the things that makes you YOU.
        
        During my hardest times this semester, trying to finish my thesis, I was genuinely depressed. I was not in the right headspace, and often when I’m in that situation, life becomes very scary for me. This time was different; you said something that gave me a reason to keep moving forward: “I'm here with you, so if nak penat, kita penat sama sama hihi” These words meant a lot to me and shows what type of person you are. You have been my strength during my darkest times. You studied with me into late at night even though you were sick, had to go to work beforhand, and sometimes I felt a bit selfish for asking you to be here, but you never complained once. I do not know how I could ever repay you for this.<br><br>
        
        Regardless of what life has planned for us, you have become a vital person in my life, and I will forever cherish that. I only wish you good things; I want to see you succeed, travel to many places with your mum, siblings, and aunts haha. Making you happy is the only thing I want to do because it also means that I am worth something to someone and capable of making someone’s life a little bit better.<br><br>

        This flower resembles what you mean to me. Whenever I'm with you, my troubles seem to fade away. You light up my days, even the darkest ones, and for once, I don't feel alone in this world anymore. I am very lucky to have met you, and I am looking forward to getting to know you better, even if takes a while :)

        p.s. When you click “Done”, to make the flower appear, you need to play your favourite tune (hint: the keyboard is a piano).<br><br>

        <div class="tomy" style="text-align: left;">Love, Mustaqim</div>
